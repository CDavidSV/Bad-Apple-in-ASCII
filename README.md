# Bad-Apple-in-ASCII

Python script that converts the bad apple music video into ASCII characters, and displays them in the terminal.

In short, I use a library that allows me to convert each frame of that video into characters that I set in a list. After this I organize them in columns and rows with respect to a specific resolution. Although it won't always be in sync with the music since it depends a lot on the speed to complete each iteration of the loop. Some frames take longer to process and this can cause the video to be completely out of sync.

In order for it to work you need to install the following Python libraries.

- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">opencv</a>
- <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html">Pillow</a>
- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/playsound/">playsound</a>

Here is a video demostration (Note that the audio was added after and the video was sped up to match the speed of the audio).
